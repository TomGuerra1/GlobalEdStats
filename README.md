#### By: Tomas Guerra

#### Date: October 4th, 2024

## Scenario
#### One of the UN's Global Sustainable Goals is the possibility to provide worlwide quality education. In order to gain an overview and idea of the current global stance of literacy levels, investments on education, and school enrollment, data from each country is pulled and analyzed. By gauging their investments and advances, we're able to understand the developments and areas of opportunity that countries currently face.

## Dataset
#### The dataset utilized for the study can be found through [here](https://data.worldbank.org/topic/education)

#### The dataset consists of 43625 rows of data that pertain to each country. As well, all records are differentiated by inidcator codes that are specific to a measurement for each country. An indicator code metadata table is part of the dataset in order to have a better understanding of each measurement.

#### The dataset has properly cited and sourced data, which makes it an extremely reliable dataset. Data's being pulled from international organizations such as UNESCO, the UN, and many other recognized institutions.

#### On the other hand, the data set seems to be missing large sets of data. This allows for the study to be constrained to only understand the perspective, development, and growth of the countries whose data is in the dataset.
